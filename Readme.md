# Node.js & Express Backend 🚀

- This repository contains my backend learning journey using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.  
- I practice building REST APIs, handling routes, middleware, and connecting databases.  
- Small backend projects and experiments are added as I learn new concepts.  
- This repo helps me strengthen my server-side development skills. ⚙️
